# 🚗✨ParkEase

## Gateless Smart Parking Management App with Machine Vision📸🔍


### Project Description

**ParkEase** is an innovative Parking Management Application that leverages **Machine Vision** to automate license plate scanning — enabling a gateless parking experience. Cars can simply drive in without stopping at gates; a camera scans their license plate, and the number is extracted using Machine Learning.

This real-world project combines cutting-edge technologies across **Machine Learning** and **Web Development** to build a fully functional smart parking system. Violators are automatically detected and reported to parking enforcement, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

The app features a comprehensive simulator built in Python using **YOLOv8** for license plate detection and uses a modern tech stack including:


- **Frontend:** ⚛️ Next.js, React
- **Backend:** 🐍 Python
- **Database:** 🍃 MongoDB
- **Machine Learning:** 🤖 YOLOv8 for real-time license plate recognition
- **Mapping:** 🗺️ Google Maps integration for location visualization
